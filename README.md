# CDM Website Project `(Paused)`
**An UNOFFICIAL website for the school: [Colegio de Muntinlupa](https://cdm.edu.ph)**

---
## Why?
Our school, Colegio de Muntinlupa has this website that seems to be not being maintained and very incomplete. We have found some *obvious* signs of poor development of the website [read below](#More) for more information. While this may be very subjective, we, *[xander](https://github.com/imxaander) and [gian](https://github.com/GianSalvadora)* decided to work on this little project that aims to completely develop a more of a clone / replica of our schools' website. Specifically, this ***static-filed*** website will not include the functionality of the student & employee portals. 

We are also trying to initiate and form a community inside cdm, to cdm-open-source projects ðŸ’™ we think that if we collaborate, we can improve some processes in the campus and maybe, build a great community that can or may lead to juicy learning of the students. 

I want everybody, including me to learn how to use git and github to collaborate with projects benefitting our school, CDM. -*xander*


## Contribution
Are you a CDM student/alumni? this repo is welcome and in need of your contributions! the contribution documentation is still in the plan, while we are working on the initial release of the website, the contribution docs is done by that date.
