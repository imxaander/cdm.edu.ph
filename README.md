# CDM Website Project
**An UNOFFICIAL website for the school: [Colegio de Muntinlupa](https://cdm.edu.ph)**

---
## Why?
Our school, Colegio de Muntinlupa has this website that seems to be not being maintained and very incomplete. We have found some *obvious* signs of poor development of the website [read below](#More) for more information. While this may be very subjective, we, *[xander](https://github.com/imxaander) and [gian](https://github.com/GianSalvadora)* decided to work on this little project that aims to completely develop a more of a clone / replica of our schools' website. Specifically, this ***static-filed*** website will not include the functionality of the student & employee portals. 

We are also trying to initiate and form a community inside cdm, to cdm-open-source projects 💙 we think that if we collaborate, we can improve some processes in the campus and maybe, build a great community that can or may lead to juicy learning of the students. 

I want everybody, including me to learn how to use git and github to collaborate with projects benefitting our school, CDM. -*xander*
